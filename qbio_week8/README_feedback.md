- For allele frequency vs generation, I think it should start with AF = 0.5 per the assignment (-0.5) 
- For Fixation time vs starting allele frequency, I think you should do the simulation like 100 times and show us the variance within those runs (-0.5) 

5/6

- For allele frequency vs generation, I think I used AF=0.5 for each question except for question 1. I think for question 1, the AF is arbituary. "Implement a Wright-Fisher simulation of allele frequencies for an arbitrary starting allele frequency and population size. The simulation should run until one of the alleless becomes fixed. Implement this simulation as a python function that takes two input arguments: the starting allele frequency, and the population size. As an output, the function should return a list that contains the allele frequency at each generation."
- For Fixation time vs starting allele frequency, I changed the plot so that it shows the variance within those runs. 
- Regrade 12/10 - I see the new plot, great! 6/6
