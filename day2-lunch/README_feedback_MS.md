First off, excellent use of comments. It makes the code very easy to read through and understand. Good use of empty lines to break the code into logical steps. And your variable names are informative. Definitely good coding habits.

Well done remembering to close your file streams.

I'm assuming that you've used pandas in the past as that's what you defaulted to for writing the output. Since you didn't actually use it, you  should get rid of the `import pandas as pd` line. Also, I think it would be good practice trying out writing the solution without pandas. It's always better to not rely on external modules (excepting the built-ins that come with python) if it doesn't make a lot of extra work. In this case, you could have used a single line print statement (either to an out file stream or the terminal) in your for loop and used an equal or fewer lines in your code without impacting its readability. That being said, your solution works just fine so this is just a helpful suggestion.
