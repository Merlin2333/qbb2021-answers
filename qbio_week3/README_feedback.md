Hi Merlin - a few things 
- For the Manhattans, we want you to label the 5 most significant SNPs (with their rsIDs) and plot the most significant SNPs in a different color (-0.5)
- For the boxplot, can you do all three genotypes (1/1, 0/1, 0/0) on one plot? And label in more detail - I'm left wondering which SNP's genotype we're looking at 

6.5/7
